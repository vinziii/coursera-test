      	<p>When I wake up, I immediately head to the bathroom to wash and cleanse my skin. I literally can't do anything before I do my skincare routine. I start by using the Clarins Gentle Foaming Cleanser, which has been a favourite for so many years now. I absolutely love all their cleansers, they clean off my make up (at night) and in the morning it's the perfect refresher to clean my pores and leave my skin silky soft.</p>
      	<p>After I cleanse my skin, I move on to toner. This Origin's Zero Oil Pore purifying toner is technically recommended for oily skin but I don't find you necessarily need to have oily skin to enjoy it's benefits. It has cooling mint ingredient which is so refreshing to use in the morning and it helps reduce your pores with it's salicylic acid.</p>
      	<p>Next up, I move up to my eyes. I love the Bio Effects EGF Eye Serum which is a powerful anti-aging formula that is specifically developed for the delicate eye area. I find it helps puffiness and brightens my skin under my eyes.</p>
      	<p>My favourite part of my morning skin care routine is when I start to hydrate it again. I usually start by using Dr. Sebagh's light weight rose de vie serum. With just a few drops, it restores tired skin and leaves a glowing complexion.</p>
      	<p>In the Winter months my skin needs a little more hydration before I apply my moisturizer,  which is where these face oils come in. They don't feel heavy and your skin instantly soaks all their goodness up!</p>
